# 🌐 Computer Network Tools & Analysis

This repository contains a **Computer Network course project** that explores essential **networking tools** such as **ping, tracert, nslookup, telnet**, and **Wireshark** for network analysis.

## 📜 Project Overview:
This project includes a **detailed PDF report** with:  
✔ Screenshots of command executions  
✔ Explanations of results  
✔ Code with comments  
✔ Wireshark DNS message captures  

## 🔧 Tools & Commands:
1️⃣ **Ping:** Tests network connectivity and measures response time.  
2️⃣ **Tracert:** Traces the route packets take to a destination.  
3️⃣ **Nslookup:** Queries domain name system (DNS) records.  
4️⃣ **Telnet:** Allows remote access to devices over a network.  

## 📂 Files Included:
- **📄 Report (PDF)**: Contains detailed explanations, screenshots, and results.  
- **💾 Code (`.py`, `.html`, or `.css`)**: Includes all relevant scripts with comments.  

## 📊 Experiments Conducted:
✔ **Ping a device on the same network**  
✔ **Ping www.stanford.edu & analyze results**  
✔ **Run tracert & nslookup on www.stanford.edu**  
✔ **Capture DNS messages using Wireshark**  

## 🚀 How to Run:
1. **Run the provided scripts** in a terminal or command prompt.  
2. **Capture and analyze DNS messages** using Wireshark.  
3. **Follow the steps in the PDF report** for explanations and results.  

This project provides practical insights into **network troubleshooting** and **packet analysis**! 🌍💡
